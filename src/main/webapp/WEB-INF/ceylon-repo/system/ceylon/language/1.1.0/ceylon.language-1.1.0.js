Iterable categories are often \ncalled _streams_. A stream need not be finite, but its \nelements must be countable. That is, for any given \nelement of the stream, every iterator of the stream must \neventually return the element, even if the iterator \nitself is not exhaustable. \n\nA given stream might not have a well-defined order, and \nso the order in which elements are produced by the \nstream's iterator may not be _stable_. That is, the order \nmay be different for two different iterators of the \nstream. However, a stream has a well-defined set of \nelements, and any two iterators for an immutable finite \nstream should eventually return the same elements. \nFurthermore, any two iterators for an immutable finite\nstream should eventually return exactly the same number \nof elements, which must be the [[size]] of the stream.\n\nA given stream may not be _finite_, in which case an \niterator for the stream is never exhaustible, and certain\noperations of this interface either never terminate or\nresult in an [[AssertionError]]. It may not, in general,\nbe possible to even determine if an `Iterable` is finite.\n\nThe type `Iterable<Element,Null>`, usually abbreviated\n`{Element*}`, represents a possibly-empty iterable \ncontainer.

Such operations come \nin two flavors:\n\n- _Lazy_ operations return a *view* of the receiving\n  iterable object. If the underlying iterable object is\n  mutable, then changes to the underlying object will be \n  reflected in the resulting view. Lazy operations are \n  usually efficient, avoiding memory allocation or\n  iteration of the receiving iterable object.\n- _Eager_ operations return an immutable object. If the\n  receiving iterable object is mutable, changes to this\n  object will not be reflected in the resulting immutable\n  object. Eager operations are often expensive, involving\n  memory allocation and iteration of the receiving \n  iterable object.\n\nLazy operations are generally preferred, because they can \nbe efficiently chained. For example:\n\n    string.filter((Character c) => c.letter)\n          .map((Character c) => c.uppercased)\n\nis much less expensive than:\n\n    string.select((Character c) => c.letter)\n          .collect((Character c) => c.uppercased)\n\nFurthermore, it is always easy to produce a new \nimmutable iterable object given the view produced by a\nlazy operation. For example:\n\n    [ *string.filter((Character c) => c.letter)\n          .map((Character c) => c.uppercased) ]\n\nHowever, there are certain scenarios where an eager \noperation is more useful, more convenient, or no more \nexpensive than a lazy operation, including:\n\n- sorting operations, for example [[sort]], which are \n  eager by nature,\n- operations which result in a subset or subrange of the \n  receiving stream, where structural sharing would or\n  could result in unnecessary memory retention.\n\nCertain operations come in both lazy and eager flavors,\nfor example:\n\n- [[map]] vs [[collect]],\n- [[filter]] vs [[select]],\n- [[List.sublist]] vs [[List.measure]].\n\nLazy operations normally return an instance of `Iterable`, \nor even a [[List]], [[Map]], or [[Set]]. Eager operations \nusually return a [[sequence|Sequential]]. The method\n[[sequence]] materializes the current elements of a\nstream into a sequence.\n\nUnlike [[Collection]], `Iterable` does not define or \nrequire any form of [[value equality|Object.equals]], and \nsome streams do not support value equality. Therefore, \nthe use of the `==` operator to compare generic iterables \nis extremely fragile and strongly discouraged.","An iterator for the elements belonging to this stream.","Determines if the stream is empty, that is to say, if \nthe iterator returns no elements.","The number of elements returned by the iterator of this \nstream, if the iterator terminates.

Declarations are singletons: there is only a single instance of a given class declaration,\n  for example. You can inspect declarations to get information about how they were defined by their\n  author. You cannot directly invoke function or class declarations, but you can _apply_ them to get\n  a _model_ that you can invoke.\n- A _model_ is a Ceylon definition that represents a declaration where all the type variables have\n  been bound to _closed type_ values. You can query models for their member models and you can directly\n  invoke models.\n- A _closed type_ is a type which does not contain any unbound type variables.\n- An _open type_ is a type which may contain unbound type variables.\n\nFor example, given the following Ceylon program:\n\n    shared abstract class MyList<T>() satisfies List<T>{}\n\nThe declaration of `MyList` represents the class declaration and contains the information that it is\n`abstract` and that it satisfies the `List<T>` open type. That type is open because it contains an\nunbound type variable `T`, which is not bound when we inspect the `MyList` class declaration.\n\nGiven an particular instance of `MyList`, we can query its (closed) type with the [[type]] function,\nand we obtain a closed type representing (for example) `MyList<Integer>`. Object instances necessarily\nhave a closed type at runtime, since in order to instantiate an object, all type arguments must be\nprovided and known during instantiation, so the type of an object instance at runtime is necessarily\na closed type: they cannot contain unbound type variables.\n\nClosed types that represent class or interfaces are also models. For example, the closed type of our\n`MyList<Integer>` instance is both a closed type and a class model: you can query its satisfied types\nand find that it satisfies `List<Integer>` closed type and model (as opposed to the class declaration\nof `MyList` which satisfies the `List<T>` open type). You can also invoke that model to obtain a new\ninstance of `MyList<Integer>`.\n\n### Model and declaration literals\n\nCeylon supports getting declaration values using either the declaration API or using declaration\nliterals:\n\n- <code>\\`module ceylon.file\\`</code> returns the [[Module|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::Module]] \n  declaration which corresponds to the `ceylon.file` module you imported in your module descriptor.\n- <code>\\`package ceylon.language.meta\\`</code> returns the [[Package|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::Package]]\n  declaration from your current module imports.\n- <code>\\`interface List\\`</code> returns the [[InterfaceDeclaration|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::InterfaceDeclaration]] \n  for the [[List|ceylon.language::List]] type.\n- <code>\\`class Integer\\`</code> returns the [[ClassDeclaration|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::ClassDeclaration]] \n  for the [[Integer|ceylon.language::Integer]] type.\n- <code>\\`function type\\`</code> returns the [[FunctionDeclaration|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::FunctionDeclaration]] \n  for the [[type]] function. Similarly <code>\\`function List.shorterThan\\`</code> for methods.\n- <code>\\`value modules\\`</code> returns the [[ValueDeclaration|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::ValueDeclaration]] \n  for the [[modules]] value. Similarly <code>\\`function List.size\\`</code> for attributes.\n- <code>\\`alias AliasName\\`</code> returns the [[AliasDeclaration|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::AliasDeclaration]]\n  for the `AliasName` type alias. \n- <code>\\`given T\\`</code> returns the [[TypeParameter|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::TypeParameter]] \n  for the `T` type parameter.\n\nNote that declaration literals cannot have type arguments specified on types or methods, as declarations are not types.\n\nYou can also get access to closed types and model using either the model API or using literals: \n\n- <code>\\`List&lt;Integer>\\`</code> returns the [[Interface|ceylon.language.meta.model::Interface]] model and \n  closed type for the [[List|ceylon.language::List]] type applied with the [[Integer|ceylon.language::Integer]] type argument.\n- <code>\\`Integer\\`</code> returns the [[Class|ceylon.language.meta.model::Class]] model and closed type \n  for the [[Integer|ceylon.language::Integer]] type.\n- <code>\\`type&lt;Integer>\\`</code> returns the [[Function|ceylon.language.meta.model::Function]] model \n  for the [[type]] function applied with the [[Integer|ceylon.language::Integer]] type argument.\n  Similarly <code>\\`List&lt;Integer>.shorterThan\\`</code> for method models.\n- <code>\\`modules\\`</code> returns the [[Value|ceylon.language.meta.model::Value]] model \n  for the [[modules]] value. Similarly <code>\\`List&lt;Integer>.size\\`</code> for attribute models.\n- <code>\\`A & B\\`</code> returns a [[IntersectionType|ceylon.language.meta.model::IntersectionType]]\n  for the `A & B` intersection type.\n- <code>\\`A | B\\`</code> returns a [[UnionType|ceylon.language.meta.model::UnionType]]\n  for the `A | B` union type.\n- <code>\\`T\\`</code> returns a [[Type|ceylon.language.meta.model::Type]] representing the runtime type \n  argument value for the `T` type parameter.\n\nNotice that all model and close type literals must be applied with all required type arguments.\n\n### Accessing the metamodel using the API\n\nAside from declaration and model literals there are several ways you can start using the metamodel API:\n\n- The [[modules]] object contains a list of all currently loaded [[Module|ceylon.language.meta.declaration::Module]]\n  declarations. Note that these contain even modules you did not import as it contains all transitive\n  dependencies, and may contain multiple different versions of the same module.\n- The [[type]] function will return the closed type of the given instance, which can only be a\n  [[ClassModel|ceylon.language.meta.model::ClassModel]] since only classes can be instantiated.\n- The [[typeLiteral]] function is the functional equivalent to closed type literals: it turns a type argument\n  value into a metamodel closed type.\n- The [declaration](declaration/index.html) package contains all the declaration and open types.\n- The [model](model/index.html) package contains all the model and closed types.\n\n### Inspecting annotations\n\nConstrained annotations can be inspected using the [[annotations]] \nfunction, like this:\n\n    // Does the process declaration have the Shared annotation?\n    value isShared = annotations(`Shared`, `value process`) exists;\n\nor the related [[optionalAnnotation]] and [[sequencedAnnotations]] functions.\n\nNote that annotations are queried for via their \n[[ceylon.language::Annotation]] type, \nnot by the annotation constructor which was used to annotate \nthe program element.\n"),by(["Gavin King","Stephane Epardaud"].reifyCeylonType({t:$_String})),shared()];};ex$.$pkg$ans$ceylon$language$meta$model=function(){return[doc("The Ceylon metamodel closed type and model package.\n\nAs described in the [ceylon.language.meta](../index.html) documentation, this package contains all\nthe types that represent Ceylon closed types and models.\n\n### Usage example\n\nThe following code will list all the value declarations in the `ceylon.language` package and print their\ncurrent value:\n\n    Package languagePackage = `package ceylon.language`;\n    ValueDeclaration[] valueDeclarations = languagePackage.members<ValueDeclaration>();\n    Value<Anything>[] valueModels = valueDeclarations*.apply<Anything>();\n    for(val in valueModels){\n        // skip the nothing value which cannot be read\n        if(val.type != `Nothing`){\n            print(val.get());\n        }\n    }\n\nThe following code will iterate all the class declarations in the `ceylon.language` package that\nare not abstract, anonymous or annotations, and that have no type parameters nor initialiser\nparameters.
